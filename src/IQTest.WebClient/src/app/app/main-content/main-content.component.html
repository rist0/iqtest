            <p class="card-text">I.Q. (intelligence quotient) in general, is an assessment of your ability to think and reason. IQ score is a standardized way of comparing this ability with the majority of people the same age as you are. A score of 100 means that compared to these people in your general age group that you have basically an average intelligence. Most psychologists would say those scoring in a range of 95 to 105 are of a normal intelligence or have an average IQ. Actual IQ score may vary plus or minus five points since it is very difficult to get an IQ score with complete accuracy. Keep in mind, there are many outside factors that may have a negative impact on your score. For instance, if you are not feeling well at the time of taking the test. Or perhaps you are distracted by something on that particular day. These things may affect your score. Additionally, IQ is not the be all end all of a person's abilities in life. IQ score fails to measure things such as manual dexterity (obviously), musical talent, and a slew of other abilities that may lead one to many different successes in life. However, your score on an IQ test will give you a pretty accurate indication of the ability you possess to think, reason and solve problems which can often be critical in many phases of your life.</p>

                        Based on the bell curve, an IQ score of 100 is considered the average and typically a score above 100 is associated with high intelligence. 
                        Scores ranging from 130 and above are considered to be in the extreme intelligence category while those with an IQ higher than 140  are considered gifted.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Low IQ scores</b><br>
                        Those who score below 85 are considered to be associated with low intelligence. 
                        A score below 70, is usually considered mentally handicap and may indicate an underlying learning disability.<br><br>
                        <b>Note:</b> A high or low score doesn’t mean that someone is particularly smart, but it means that the person has "potential".<br><br>
